All captcha images that get generated will get temporarily saved into this file. Once the captcha has been completed, the image should be removed.

If this folder is getting filled up with captchas' that aren't getting removed, run the clearcaptchas.py file and they will all be removed.

You can delete this file but DO NOT delete the folder that this file is in.
